# SOLVED Command

## Channel Management Problems No More!

Use `~solved` when you've solved a puzzle in your channel! The bot will prepend `solved-` to 
the channel name so everyone will know the puzzle has been solved. 
Use `~unsolved` to remove the `solved` prefix.

Other options (same functionality):
- `~solvedish` and `~unsolvedish`
- `~backsolved` and `~unbacksolved`
