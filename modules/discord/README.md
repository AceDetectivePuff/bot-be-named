# Discord Commands

## Discord Utility commands

- `~stats` prints out server stats (e.g. number of members, number of emoji)
- `~pin` pins the previous message. Alternatively, you can reply to a message with `~pin`,
which will pin the message you replied to (this is especially useful for fast-moving chats, since
  the order may get mixed up)
- `~unpin` unpins the previous message. You can optionally supply a number of messages to unpin
  (e.g. `~unpin 4`) and that many messages will be unpinned (up to the number of pins in the channel)
