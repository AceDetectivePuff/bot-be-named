# WIP MUSIC RACE

Want to have perfect pitch? Now you can! Play with our music race
and you'll be identifying every note you ever hear (whether that's good or not hehe)

- `~note <octave> <flat_or_nat>` will output a random 5-second note from a piano.
  Adding `flat` will ensure you get a flat/sharp note, `nat` will ensure you get a natural note,
  and the `octave` (integer) will ensure you get a note in that octave.
  
We hope to add more features soon.
