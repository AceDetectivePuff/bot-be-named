# CREATE CHANNEL Command

## Channel Management Problems No More!

Need to create channels on the spot as you unlock more puzzles in your puzzle hunt? 
Well, now you can! Use `~createchannel <channel_name>` to create a channel in the
category you're currently in. If you made a channel in the wrong category, not to worry!
Head over to [movechannel](https://github.com/kevslinger/DiscordCipherRace/tree/main/modules/move_channel)
and move the channel to that category!
